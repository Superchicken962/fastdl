<h2 class="box1">But what is a fastdl server?
<p class="box2">A fast download server, or a FastDL server is a site that mirrors the custom assets used by your game server.<br> Downloads directly from the game server are slow, regardless the connection speed between the server and the client.<br>A fastdl server allows for the clients to download all of the custom files from the site, making it much faster, Hence why its called "fastdl."</p>
<h1 class="box3">Why you should use our fastdl server:
<p class="box4">Our Fast download server is free for you to use and we will upload any file you want, providing it follows our guidelines.<br>The setup of the fastdl server is really easy and is only adding one to three lines of command to your server.cfg</p></h1>
