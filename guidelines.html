<h1>Guidelines</h1>
<p>Please read all of the guidelines and follow them while sending your file(s) or else they wont be uploaded.</p>
</section><br>
<section class="guidelinesblock2">
<h3>1. Be Patient</h3>
<p>Your files will be uploaded as soon as possible. Don't rush it.</p>
<h3>2. Respect Everyone</h3>
<p>Pretty simple, just respect everyone and have an overall good atitude! (I mean, you are getting this for free!)</p>
<h3>3. Format email nicely</h3>
<p>Not as big of a guideline as others but it is appreciated if you make your message tidy and easy to read.</p>
<h3>4. No explicit, defamatory or racist content</h3>
<p>We will not accept any explicit content (such as gore, pornography, racial slurs)</p>
<h3>5. Accept file declines</h3>
<p>If your file gets declined and doesn't get uploaded, don't throw a tantrum. You can ask why it was declined, but still do this in a nice manner.</p>
<h3>6. No demanding</h3>
<p>Demanding doesn't help in anyway and can get you temporarily banned from requesting files.</p>
<h3>7. Try to compress your files (Courtesy)</h3>
<p>This is not necessary at all, however it would be greatly appreciated if you did compress your files into a .bz2 format before sending them.</p>
